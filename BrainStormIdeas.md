# Brainstorm

## IDEA 1 - Super ultra cringe ninja warrior
- platformer with different levels
- pass obstacles
- there's a super cringe commentator saying super cringe stuff
- wasd movement, grab onto things, wall run

## IDEA 2 - Catch all the humans - *WINNER*
- Aliens host game shows, too
- claw machine game show, you try to catch the humans
- the more you catch, the higher the score
- obstacles: suicide bombers, they kill you, you lose. dogs - dogs are good, you can't pick them up
- blondes 30 points,
- brunettes 40,
- redheads rare, super fast, a lot of points
- ninja guy, can dodge hook
- destroy buildings to limit human movement


## IDEA 3 - yes or no
- choice game, answer yes or no questions
- questions aren't suitable for yes/no answers
- when did baron die? yer or no?
- correct answer is completely random
