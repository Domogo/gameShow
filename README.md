Aliens have game shows, too. This one in particular is about abducting humans from their home plane, dirt -- sorry! -- Earth! The game show hosts drop a huge Claw Machine on the surface of our planet while Flixtraxs' and Flixtraxes, males and females of their species, watch as the contestant tries to gather enough of us, humans, to win the Tesla car that they found floating in our atmosphere!
